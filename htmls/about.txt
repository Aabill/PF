        <p>I would like to apply as an  <b>  Associate Software Engineer</b> (entry level) for Accenture.

        I am willing to learn new languages, tools or frameworks for the company, and 

        I am desperate to share my skills and excited to learn more about coding.</p>
        
        <p>My ambition is to become a <b>full-stack developer. </b> When I'm not coding, I like to play some musical instruments or sing, play basketball, or play some dota.</p></div>
